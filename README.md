Current task: Create a recipe project to sharpen my HTML abilities.
Finished task on 9/23. Will revisit once more skills are obtained.
The best thing I learned from this was how to create local links within my webpage. 
I am pleased with the way my project turned out and excited to modify it with CSS and JS later on. 

9/27/22: Adding CSS to the original file.
